# Learning Material 

## Free Course Material Online:
1. Stanford [CS 324](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/) is a self-contained LLM Book! üôè Stanford University had released lecture notes of their Large Language Model course. These notes are actually an incredibly organized self-contained book covering the foundations of Large Language Models
 My favorite part is these are structured as an onion, going from an overview and slowly going a level further with every page. These also have the best notes I have read on Mixture of Experts
